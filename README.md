# Amara CobWeb

This is one of my open source projects that's included in The Amara Project. I'm developing a multiparadigm webcrawler and scraper as a CLI Tool!
The Amara CobWeb will only take YAML files as configuration! You will have to follow a specific config structure!

Using Poetry as a Dependency manager and Build tool!
