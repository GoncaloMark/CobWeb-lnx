# CobWeb

CobWeb is a Python library for web scraping. The library consists of two classes: Spider and Scraper.

## Spider

The Spider class is used to crawl a website and identify internal and external links. It has the following methods:

    __init__(self, url, max_hops = 0): Initializes a Spider object with the given URL and maximum number of links to follow from the initial URL.
    _getLinks(self): Crawls the website and identifies internal and external links.
    _showLinks(self): Returns the set of internal and external URLs found during crawling.
    __str__(self): Returns a string representation of the Spider object.
    __repr__(self): Returns a string representation of the Spider object.

## Scraper

The Scraper class extends the functionality of the Spider class by scraping HTML content from web pages based on user-defined parameters. It has the following methods:

    __init__(self, config): Initializes a Scraper object with the given configuration parameters.
    run(self): A public method to scrape HTML content from web pages based on user-defined parameters.
    __str__(self): Returns a string representation of the Scraper object.
    __repr__(self): Returns a string representation of the Scraper object.

## Installation

You can install CobWeb using pip:

```bash

    pip install CobWeb

```

## Config

Config is either an object in memory or a YAML file you can build by installing YAMLbuilder or by using the provided template!
Example of a complete object:

```python
config = {
            "url": 
            "hops": 
            "tags":
            "classes":
            "attrs":
            "attrV":
            "IDv":
            "selectors":
        }
```

Example of YAML file (If you choose this path call the config_parser function and give it a valid path!):

```yaml
IDv:
attrV: []
attrs: []
classes: []
hops: 
selectors: []
tags:
    - 
    - 
url: 
```

## Example Usage

```python

from CobWeb import Spider, Scraper

# Create a Spider object with a URL and maximum number of hops
spider = Spider("https://example.com", max_hops=10)

# Get the internal and external links
links = spider.run()
print(links)

# Create a Scraper object with a configuration dictionary
# hops defines how deep it will scrape, it uses the Spider internally to get more links and scrape from those pages! If you just want to scrape from a single page set it to 0 or don't provide hops
config = {
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "hops": 2,
    "tags": ["h1", "p"]
    }
scraper = Scraper(config)

# Scrape HTML content from web pages based on user-defined parameters
results = scraper.run()

# Print the results it shall be a dictionary with arrays of scraped content separated by element, attributes, etc provided in the config!
print(results)


```
